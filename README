Intro
-----
A quick attempt to use a Brother PT-1230PC PT-2430PC under
Linux. This driver has no connection to Brother Industries, Ltd.

Based on the information I got from the QL-500/550 page:
http://etc.nkadesign.com/Printers/QL550LabelPrinter

Official PT-9500PC Raster Mode Command Reference PDF:
http://etc.nkadesign.com/uploads/Printers/95CRRASE.pdf

The switch set to the "E" position so that it appears as a USB
printer to Linux.

Install
-------
make builds a static version of pt1230. See github ref.
ghostscript for converting arbitrary text.

pt1230 sends a 64 pixel wide pbm file (created by gimp etc.)
to the printer on /dev/usb/lp0 and a script which creates a 64
pixel wide pbm file from it's arguments using gs.

TODO
----
	So many things ...
	
	Look at the tape width returned from the printer and decide
		if the image needs to be cropped/centered
	The data sent to the printer could be optimised but given
		USB is so fast compared to the printer, is it worth it?
	Are there any different settings for different types of tape ?
	
Usage examples
--------------
cat image.pbm | pt1230 | lpr -PPT-1230PC

pt1230 -f data.raw image.pbm

pt1230 -f /dev/usb/lp1 image.pbm

./labelprint "Hello World!"


# Best to do images w. gimp.
Have image in .xcf and save .pbm (ASCII)
Image size approx 64x512 pixels for 12 mm TZ tape

cat vortex_low_power_label.pbm | pt1230 > /dev/usb/lp1
cat sensor-case.pbm | pt1230 > /dev/usb/lp1


Issues
------
It's possible protection needs to be altered.
sudo chown root:lpadmin /dev/usb/lp1

Sometimes the device /dev/usb/lp1 seems to be locked
by Ubuntu (16.04 LTS). Reboot helps.
